# My TypeScript React Authentication App

This is a simple TypeScript-based React application with an authentication form. The application uses `Formik` for handling form submission and validation, and `Yup` for schema validation. It allows users to log in and optionally save their email for future logins using `localStorage`.

## Features:
- Login form with email and password fields.
- Email is saved to `localStorage` when "Remember Me" is selected.
- Form validation using `Yup` for email and password fields.
- Success message after successful login submission.

## Tech Stack:
- **React**: Frontend library for building UI.
- **TypeScript**: For static typing in the code.
- **Formik**: For managing form state and handling form submissions.
- **Yup**: For form validation.
- **localStorage**: To remember the email for future logins.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-tsx-auth-app.git
cd my-tsx-auth-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the React development server and open the application in your default web browser. If the page does not open automatically, visit `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### 4. Run the app in production (optional):

For production, you can build the app and serve it using the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000/` to see the production build.

## How it works:

1. The `LoginForm` component is the core of the application. It uses **Formik** for managing form state and **Yup** for validation.
2. The form contains two fields, **email** and **password**, and a **Remember Me** checkbox.
3. When the form is submitted:
   - If the **Remember Me** checkbox is checked, the email is saved to `localStorage`.
   - The success message "Login Successful" is displayed after the form submission.
   - If validation fails, error messages are displayed under the respective fields.

## File Structure:

```
/public          - Public files like HTML and images
/src             - Source code for React app
  └── App.tsx    - Main React component
  └── LoginForm.tsx - Form component
  └── index.tsx  - Entry point for React app
  └── App.css    - Optional styles for the app
  └── index.css  - Global styles
/package.json    - NPM configuration file
/tsconfig.json   - TypeScript configuration file
```

## Troubleshooting:

- **Issue: Localhost is not opening in the browser:**
  - Ensure that the server is running on `http://localhost:3000` by checking the terminal output for errors.
  - Try opening the page manually by typing `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

- **Issue: Dependencies not found:**
  - Ensure that you've run `npm install` in the project directory to install all the required dependencies.
